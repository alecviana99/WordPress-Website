Help users easily find and discover products in your store using Ajax Search for WooCommerce – a highly customizable live search plugin.

== Description ==

The plugin allows you to display the WooCommerce AJAX search form anywhere on the page. 

Just enter a few letters and the products which best match your query will appear. 
Suggestions can be displayed in a simple form (names of the products only) or in an extended form (includes photos, prices, descriptions, extended information etc.).

Ajax Search for WooCommerce has been designed to enhance user search experience to the maximum.

= Free =
This plugin is completely free of charge and provides the whole range of functions which are included in some paid plugins.
Initially, I created the plugin for my personal use, but I have decided to include new features and make it available to WordPress community.
